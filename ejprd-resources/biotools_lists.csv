It allows to easily transform raw data into semantic data, e.g. to convert values (e.g. rs28897716) into concepts (e.g. gene, variant, disease), and concepts into relations (e.g. variant is_associated_to disease). In a single package, COEUS provides the tools for data management, including advanced algorithms to integrate different data sources, such as spreadsheets and databases. Currently, COEUS is being explored to standardize and link several rare diseases patient registries and biobanks, enabling distributed access.",Developed by: University of Aveiro,,,,crosslinkWGCNANetwork analysis for multi-omics data integration,"The crosslinkWGCNA web tool provides a user-friendly interface to the popular Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) R package. Users are able to upload their data sets and subsequently apply the standard workflow steps using a project-based structure and an easy to navigate interface. Along the way, the tool provides multiple familiar visualizations such as the hierarchically clustered genes with color-coded clusters, a similar tree for the samples and sample traits, module-trait correlations, and more. In addition, the tool allows for integrating multiple WGCNA projects using a correlation-based approach. Both data and visualizations can be exported.",Developed by Leiden University Medical Center.,https://github.com/LUMC-BioSemantics/crosslinkWGCNA,,,DiseasecardRare diseases research portal,"Diseasecard is a mature collaborative portal integrating and disseminating genetic and medical information on rare diseases.

A machine-learning methodology (decision-tree induction) allows to induce generalized pharmacogenomic translation models from known haplotype – tables that are able to infer the metabolizer status of individuals from their genotype profiles. ePGA can be of benefit to health professionals, biomedical researchers and general public and may have a great impact in the clinic, even towards the use of a pharmacogenomics card/electronic health record.",Developed by: University of Patras,http://www.epga.gr/,"Publications: Lakiotaki et al., 2016",,Human Splicing FinderPathogenicity prediction in splice site mutations,The tool help studying intronic and exonic mutations affecting pre-mRNA splicing signals acceptor/donor splice sites as well as branch points or auxiliary splicing signals such as Exonic Splicing Enhancers (ESE) and Exonic Splicing Silencers (ESS). The tool contains an expert system to assist the user to interpret data. It also contains new matrices to evaluate the impact of mutations on rare donor splice site motifs.,Developed by: Aix-Marseille University Medical School,http://www.umd.be/HSF/,"Publication: Desmet FO et al., Nucleic Acids Res, 2009",,Knowledge.bioLiterature-Wide Association Study,"This data resource and workflow helps to pass over from gene to disease using literature mining technology in a Literature-Wide Association Study (LWAS), and from disease to phenotypes and genes using the Monarch initiative database. LWAS provides access to the relevant biomedical knowledge of any particular gene-disease combination, thus moving away from black box approaches. Experts can interpret potential biological mechanisms from the provided biomedical knowledge. The machine readable format of the LWAS dataset is compliant with FAIR Data Publishing recommendations and is a part of a software (knowledge.bio) facilitating data integration, use and reuse. Integration of the gene-disease associations datasource into the RD-Connect platform is currently underway.",Developed by: Leiden University Medical Center,,"Publications: Hettne et al., 2016 and Bruskiewich et al., 2016",,Patient ArchiveExtracting phenotype ontology concepts from free text clinical records,"Patient Archive (PA) translates deep clinical phenotyping and genome-scale biology to patient-centered human disease pathogenesis. The detailed phenotype profile created in PA, combined with data helps identify the causes of the disease, and make clear diagnosis and prognosis. Unlike other platforms, PA creates a patient clinical phenotype profile by automatic extraction of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) concepts from free text clinical records or the labels of uploaded images. The HPO terms are then used for patient matchmaking, disorder prediction or gene list generation. Clinical data exchange is protected with secure access control and fully integrated into the GA4GH MatchMaker Exchange. Program. Patient Archive helps to harmonize phenomic information for translational and clinical use. PA was developed as part of the Monarch Initiative.",Developed by: Garvan Institute of Medical Research,,,,Rare Disease Registry Framework (RDRF)Creation of web-based patient registries,"The Rare Disease Registry Framework (RDRF) is an open-source tool, which is unique in that it enables the dynamic creation of web-based patient registries with minimal software development. Utilising the RDRF, we have deployed national and international patient-driven and clinical registries including: the Myotubular and Centronuclear Myopathy Patient Registry, the Global Angelman Syndrome Registry, the Familial Hypercholesterolaemia Australasia Network Registry, and the Australian and New Zealand Neuromuscular Disorders Registries (Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Spinal Muscular Atrophy, and Myotonic Dystrophy Registries). The deployment of these registries involved the development of key new features, such as:

patient registration and log-in, enabling patient-reported data entry combined with verification by clinicians;
family linkage, to enable the tracking of cascade screening for familial hypercholesterolaemia;
automatic notifications, enabling emails to be sent from the RDRF;
‘context’, which enables enhanced capture of longitudinal data through ‘multi-forms’.
New features and enhancements continue to be deployed within the RDRF, with all registries able to benefit from continued development.","Developed by: Centre for Comparative Genomics, Murdoch University",https://muccg.github.io/rdrf/,,,ScaleusSemantic web services integration for biomedical applications,"Scaleus is a data migration tool that can be used on top of traditional systems to enable semantic web features.
