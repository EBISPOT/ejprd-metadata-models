Usually the knees are the earliest and most affected muscles. In advanced stages, involvement of the shoulder girdle (resulting in scapular winging) and the distal muscle groups are observed. Calf hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy, respiratory impairment, tendon contractures, scoliosis, and exercise-induced myoglobinuria may be observed."	"119"

Newborns are usually preterm infants with low birth-weights, that encounter feeding difficulties (including vomiting with initial feeds, which may later worsened and the abdomen becomes progressively distended) as well as failure to thrive. Affected children present disrupted bowel loops assuming a spiral configuration resembling an 'apple peel' and may have less than half of the normal length of the small bowel and a physiologically short bowel. Atresia of small intestine is characterized by jejunal atresia near the ligament of Treitz, foreshortened bowel, and a large mesenteric gap. The bowel distal to the atresia is precariously supplied. Atresia of small intestine may be a manifestation of cystic fibrosis (see this term). The most important cause of mortality is short bowel syndrome (see this term), encountered in 65% of cases."

It infects humans occasionally, mostly immunocompromised patients. Some infected people may have no symptoms or only mild diarrhea and abdominal discomfort but others may experience more severe symptoms reminiscent of an acute inflammation of the intestines. Symptoms of Balantidiasis may be similar to those of other infections that cause intestinal inflammation, for example, amoebic dysentery. On very rare occasions this bacterium may invade extra-intestinal organs, mostly the lungs. Metronidazole is the treatment of choice."	"1223"

It is usually diagnosed in early infancy and in early adolescence.

The initial symptom is a prolonged febrile seizure on day 1 (the first phase). Afterwards, patients have variable levels of consciousness from normal to coma. Irrespective of the consciousness levels, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during the first 2 days shows no abnormality. During the second phase (usually days 4 - 6), patients show a cluster of seizures and deterioration of consciousness. Diffusion-weighted images (DWI) on MRI reveal the brain lesions with reduced diffusion predominantly in the subcortical white matter. After the second acute phase, consciousness levels improve with the emerging focal neurological signs. Neurological outcomes of AESD vary from normal to mild or severe sequelae including cerebral atrophy, mental retardation, paralysis and epilepsy."	"363549"

The inner ear anomalies are described as dilatation of the internal auditory meatus and fistulous connection between the cochlear basal turn and internal auditory canal resulting in perilympatic gusher on attempted mobilization of a fixed stapes. Obligate female carriers may suffer from mild to moderate hearing loss."	"383"

Pauci-immune GN is histologically characterized by focal necrotizing and crescentic GN, with mild or absent glomerular staining for immunoglobulin and complement by fluorescence microscopy, which may manifest either as part of a systemic small vessel vasculitis (including microscopic polyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (see these terms)), or rarely as part of renal-limited vasculitis (RLV, idiopathic crescentic GN). Immunologic classification is based on the presence or absence of circulating anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs), namely pauci-immune-GN with ANCA and pauci-immune GN without ANCA (see these terms)."

It is a rare malformation, with only around hundred cases reported in the literature. When symptoms are present, they are caused by cerebrovascular insufficiency, compression of the brain by vessels that dilate to compensate for the absence of the ICA, or the presence of an aneurysm. Associated intracranial aneurysms occur in 25 to 35% of patients and are often responsible for intracranial hemorrhage, which may present as the initial symptom. The absence of the ICA is the result of either agenesis or aplasia. The term agenesis is used when both the ICA and its bony canal are absent, whereas there is some evidence of carotid canals in cases of aplasia. The absence of the ICA can be detected by angiography or by computerised tomography."	"981"
