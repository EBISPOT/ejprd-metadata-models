This directory contains a couple of examples for validation of data about registries and registry catalogues.
Validation of SHACL-files can be done using the SHACL-playground, which can be found here: https://shacl.org/playground/

Notice that in this playground you can use JSON-LD and Turtle-format.

Conversion can be done using any of these (and probably others):
- http://rdfvalidator.mybluemix.net/
- http://www.easyrdf.org/converter
- https://rdf-translator.appspot.com/

Validation of RDF can be done using the W3C validator:
https://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/
